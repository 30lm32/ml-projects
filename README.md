###  00-spam_sms_classification
-------------------------------
In this project, `Naive Bayesian`, `SVM`, `Random Forest Classifier`, and `Deeplearing (LSTM)` on top of `Keras (Tensorflow)` with `Gensim` to create `word2vec` and `TF-IDF` were used respectively to classify SMS as an either spam or ham. 

### 01-deep_learning_keras_nlp
-------------------------------
In this project, you are expected to learn a Machine Learning model that classifies a given line as belonging to one of the following 12 novels:

0. alice_in_wonderland
1. dracula
2. dubliners
3. great_expectations
4. hard_times
5. huckleberry_finn
6. les_miserable
7. moby_dick
8. oliver_twist
9. peter_pan
10. talw_of_two_cities
11. tom_sawyer

`Deeplearing (LSTM)` on top of `Keras (Tensorflow)` is performing the novel corpus data to solve this problem 
after creating `word2vec` by using `Gensim`.

### 02-imbalanced_car_booking_data
--------------------------------
In this project, we tried to solve `imbalanced data` using `over/under resampling techniques`

### 03-time_series_analyis_on_sales_data
--------------------------------
In this project, we applied `time series decomposition techniques` and `random forest algorithm` to build a ML model

### 04-ml_model_docker_web_service
--------------------------------
In this project, a `ML micro-service` was developed by using `REST` and `Docker` after building a ML model using `random forest algoritm`

### 05-join_data_by_geolocation
--------------------------------
In this project, two different data set which have location based `(GPS)` feature were joined `Kd-tree`.
