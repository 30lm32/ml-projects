To implement ML based system on top of micro service architecture, Docker tech. were used in this project.

You can use docker-compose command to launch the micro services, below.
1 - Jupyter Notebook,
2 - Restful Comm. (Flask),
3 - Redis

After you create three different container, you can use simple shell scripts (predict.sh, predict_random.sh)

predict.sh: It is sending features to our service and receiving response.
predict_random.sh: It is picking a row over validation set, randomly and then testing it our ML model under resources directory

Under resources directory, you can find our final pickle files, and cleaned csv files.

To take a look at data processing stage, you can go to directly notebook/code/model.ipynb file, or
You can open it on your browser using the ip address (http://localhost:8888/?token=<token>) of notebook.

Please, note that you need to replace <Token> field with your specific token you have in the address.
