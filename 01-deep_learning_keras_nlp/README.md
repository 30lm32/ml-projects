In this project, you are expected to learn a Machine Learning model that classifies a given line as belonging to one of the following 12 novels:

0. alice_in_wonderland
1. dracula
2. dubliners
3. great_expectations
4. hard_times
5. huckleberry_finn
6. les_miserable
7. moby_dick
8. oliver_twist
9. peter_pan
10. talw_of_two_cities
11. tom_sawyer

`Deeplearing (LSTM)` on top of `Keras (Tensorflow)` is performing the novel corpus data to solve this problem 
after creating `word2vec` by using `Gensim`.
